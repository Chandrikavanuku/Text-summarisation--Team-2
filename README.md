Todayâ€™s digital age, the vast and continuous generation of textual information across various domains has created a pressing need for tools that can help manage and understand large volumes of content efficiently. From news articles, blogs, and academic papers to emails, corporate reports, and social media posts, users are often overwhelmed by the amount of information they need to process daily. This has led to the growing importance of text summarization, a technique within the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which focuses on automatically generating concise and meaningful summaries from longer pieces of text. 
Text summarization serves multiple purposes, such as reducing reading time, improving content discoverability, aiding quick decision-making, and enhancing user comprehension. It is especially beneficial in scenarios where users need to scan through a large number of documents or articles quickly, such as in legal research, academic study, or news aggregation. 
There are two main types of text summarization: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization identifies and extracts key sentences or phrases from the original text based on certain ranking criteria like frequency, position, or semantic similarity. In contrast, abstractive summarization involves interpreting the original text and generating new, shorter sentences that express the same meaning, often resulting in more natural and fluent summaries. While extractive methods are generally easier to implement and computationally less intensive, abstractive methods are more challenging but closer to how humans summarize content. 
With the advancement of deep learning and neural language models, the capabilities of text summarization systems have improved significantly. Transformer-based architectures such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), GPT 
(Generative Pretrained Transformer), BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers), and T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) have introduced sophisticated mechanisms like self-attention, enabling models to capture contextual and semantic nuances more effectively. 
This project explores both extractive and abstractive summarization approaches using cutting-edge NLP models and tools. The system performs key preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization to prepare input data, and it applies summarization algorithms to generate outputs. The quality of summaries is evaluated using established metrics like ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting
